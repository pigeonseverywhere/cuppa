# Cuppa
A little menu bar app to easily keep your mac screen awake. 

It wraps around the Apple command line utility `caffeinate`, to provide a smoother
experience.

### A little bit of lore
I had previously been a user of Tomas Franz√©n's app *Caffeine*, but sadly maintainence for
it ceased a few years ago. Then, a while back I stumbled across the `caffeinate`
command, and powered by curiosity about Apple development I made a dead simple menu bar app (probably my first few pieces of personal code) to use for a few years. 

Recently I decided to revamp this personal utility a bit and polish it up- so here we are.
