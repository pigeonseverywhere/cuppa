# Cuppa
A little menu bar app to easily keep your mac screen awake. 

It wraps around the Apple command line utility `caffeinate`, to provide a smoother
experience. 

### A little bit of lore? 
I had previously been a user of Tomas Franz√©n's app [Caffeine](https://www.lightheadsw.com/caffeine/), but sadly maintainence for
it ceased a few years ago. After digging around and stumbling across the `caffeinate`
command, I made a dead simple menu bar app (probably my first piece of code) to use personally for a few years. 

After actually getting into coding, I decided to revamp this personal utility a bit and polish it up- and here we are.
